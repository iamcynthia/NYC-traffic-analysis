                    <p>Traffic problem is always a critical problem for well-developed countries and New York City has no exception.
                        It is really important to find out how to solve this problem since it has big impact on citizens, cities, countries or even the global environment.</p>
                    <p>In fact, there are several aspects to determine traffic congestion. Weather can be one aspect. Take rainy day as an example, it may slow down the speed of cars on the road, and
                        affect traffic safety. Another aspect can be the incidents happened on the road such as traffic incident or road construction. Last but not least, traffic volume is the most
                        intuitive aspect, since it identifies the flow time periods in particular time on specific road. Within these three aspects, the data of traffic volume counts is much large.
                        Therefore, this website will choose the last aspect (traffic volume counts) to find out the places commonly have traffic jam.</p>

                    <p>In order to find out which place is more commonly to have traffic jam, the three following questions are my research questions.
                        By the dataset I use, it can compare the traffic volumes in each road in different road types and represents the road which has maximum traffic.
                        Also, compare the road hourly and daily to show when is the peak hour in a day and the difference between weekday and weekend.</p>

                        <p class="tm-text-color-2">In the first chart, it is obviously that <strong>Avenue has the max load of traffic.</strong>The reason for it might because it is the main road for
                        citizens and there have many Avenues in New York City. Since the situation of data collection is quite complete, therefore, Avenue has
                        the maximum traffic among other road types.</p>

                        <p class="tm-text-color-2">In the second bar chart, data are grouped by road type and represents with each road names. While changing the road type, you will see the scale
                        changed accordingly, and it shows that Cross Bronx Expressway got the highest traffic volume, account for 3,880,416 cars half a year. Other
                        roads and road types are way more lower traffic.</p>

                        <p class="tm-text-color-2">In the third chart, You can first choose the road type then road names to look for the connected scatter plot of traffic volume for a specific
                        road in a day. Most roads got similar curve. The rush hour locates in 8-9 am and 5-7 pm, which is exactly correct in reality. Off-peak time is
                        in 2-4 am when most people are sleeping.</p>

                        <p class="tm-text-color-2"><strong>Interesting Finding</strong><br>Focus on the third chart, it can show not only how much the traffic volume
                            are in each road, but also the distribution of traffic per hour. Take Cross Bronx Expressway as an example. Interestingly, this
                            expressway has really busy traffic at most time. It kept having over 180,000 cars on the expressway from 8am to 8pm for about half a
                            year. Peak hour on this expressway is really long, which means that it must be a main artery in New York City. After verifying with
                            Google map, Cross Bronx Expressway connect with two districts in New York, which is The Bronx and Queens.</p>
                        <p class="tm-text-color-2"><strong>Strengths</strong><br>All charts on my website are continuous. In the first chart, we first find out that
                            Avenue is the source of traffic. The next chart can show which road in Avenue has maximum traffic. (It can show also other traffic volume
                            for other road type) In the third chart, it shows the time flow of a specific road. All these can help figure out which road has heavy
                            traffic.</p>
                        <p class="tm-text-color-2"><strong>Limitation</strong><br>The main limitation of my approach is data is not complete enough, since the
                            dataset only collect 5 discontinuous months in 2017, and even have different road for each month. Thus, it is hard to analysis
                            this question accurately.<br>Besides, all charts in my project show the total traffic volume which is quite broad, so it is hard
                            to find out the counts for a road or road type daily.</p>

                        <p class="tm-text-color-2">In order to ease the traffic pressure, adopting a congesting pricing is a
                            low-cost solution since it encourages people to change their travel time from peak hours to other time. Therefore, we can try adopt
                            this method on the road that has maximum traffic.</p>
                        <p class="tm-text-color-2"><strong>Reflection</strong><br>Since the charts on my website needs to choose the road on our own to know the
                        situation of that specific road, and this causes lots of time to find out which road have maximum traffic. Thus, I would rather improve
                        it as an automatic chart, which can show the order of the traffic volume for each road and road type.</p>
